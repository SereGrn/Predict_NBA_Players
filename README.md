# Predict_NBA_Players
This scoring project aims to predict, using different statistics on young NBA players, if these players will have a career of more than 5 years, and therefore if it is worthwhile for an investor to invest on them. This project was done on Python, and a Dash application is also associated with it.
To do this, I trained and validated a classifier using a precision score function. I chose precision as a metric, because this classification is intended to help investors: their goal is not to invest on a maximum of players, but on a maximum of players whose career is supposed to last more than 5 years. The accuracy score therefore minimizes false positives (and therefore prevents investors from losing money). 
Among a set of different classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting and random forests), I chose the most efficient one with respect to the precision score and the number of false positives. I then performed tuning on this classifier to identify the best parameters. 
Finally, I created an API using Dash. This API presents the dataset used, the results of the classification, and allows to make a unitary query on the players.  To launch this API, you just have to run the python script called "NBA", and to copy and paste the url of the API provided in the console in a browser.
